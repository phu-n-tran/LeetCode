"""
    Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O' (the letter O), capture all 
    regions surrounded by 'X'.

    A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.

    Example:
          X X X X
          X O O X
          X X O X
          X O X X
      
      After running your function, the board should be:
          X X X X
          X X X X
          X X X X
          X O X X
          
    Explanation:
        Surrounded regions shouldnâ€™t be on the border, which means that 
        any 'O' on the border of the board are not flipped to 'X'. Any 'O'
        that is not on the border and it is not connected to an 'O' on the
        border will be flipped to 'X'. Two cells are connected if they are
        adjacent cells connected horizontally or vertically.
