    Given an array of citations sorted in ascending order (each citation is 
    a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the
    researcher's h-index.

    According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has 
    index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the
    other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

    Example:
        Input: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
        Output: 3 
        Explanation: [0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total 
                     and each of them had received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations 
                     respectively. Since the researcher has 3 papers with at 
                     least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more
                     than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
    Note:
        If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken 
        as the h-index.

    Follow up:
        1. This is a follow up problem to H-Index, where citations is now guaranteed 
           to be sorted in ascending order.
        2. Could you solve it in logarithmic time complexity?
